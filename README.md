## i-sticky

"position: sticky" jQuery plugin / polyfill. Takes use of the [BEM](http://bem.info)-notation by default.
Based on [position--sticky- polyfill](https://github.com/matthewp/position--sticky-) by Matthew Phillips.

### Limitations

* only vertical direction is supported
* if native position:sticky support is detected, the plugin does nothing
* you shouldn't set `left` or `right` CSS properties on sticky positioned element
* you should set `top`, `bottom` or `margin-left` properties in pixels only
* parent block of position:sticky element MUST have position different from static (f.e., relative is a good choice)


### Usage

jQuery is required (tested with 1.8.3, should work with 1.7.0 or newer). Then write some JS:

```js
$('.i-sticky').iSticky({
    holderClass:      'i-sticky__holder',
    holderAutoHeight: false
});
```

You should write CSS rules by yourself, as you normally would. For example:

```css
/* sticky element */
.i-sticky {
    position: relative;
    position: -webkit-sticky;
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
    height: 30px;
}
/* it's placeholder, generated by plugin */
.i-sticky + .i-sticky__holder {
    height: 30px;
}
/* don't forget to change positioning of parent element */
.some-sticky-parent {
    position: relative;
}
```

### Methods

Remove sticky style

```js
$('.i-sticky').iSticky('unstick');
```

### Configuration

* `holderClass` contains className for the placeholder element, that is created to hold original element's place. Default value is `i-sticky__holder`
* `holderAutoHeight` when set true, the plugin will recalculate placeholder's height. Otherwise, your CSS should define it. Defaults to `false`.
